Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, 
    application deployment, and task automation. 
    It allows you to define infrastructure as code using simple,
     human-readable YAML files called playbooks.
      Ansible uses an agentless architecture,
       meaning it doesn't require any software to be
        installed on the target machines. 
        Instead, it connects via SSH (for Linux/Unix systems) or WinRM (for Windows systems) to execute tasks remotely.
