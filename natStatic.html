        Static NAT Provides a Permanent Public Identity for Internal Hosts
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-5xl">
        Static Network Address Translation, commonly known as Static NAT,
        creates a fixed, one-to-one mapping between a private IP address and
        a public IP address. Unlike dynamic methods, this translation does
        not change and remains consistent at all times.

          What Is Static NAT?
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Static NAT maps one private IP address to one public IP address.
          Whenever traffic is sent or received, the same translation is used.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          This means an internal device always appears on the internet
          with the same public IP address.

          Why Static NAT Exists
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Some network devices must be reachable from the internet at a
          known and predictable address. Examples include web servers,
          mail servers, and network management systems.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Static NAT ensures that external users can reliably reach
          these internal resources.

          The Problem It Solves
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Private IP addresses are not routable on the public internet.
          Without translation, internal servers would be invisible
          to external clients.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Static NAT solves this by providing a valid public address
          while keeping the internal addressing scheme unchanged.

          Consistency and Reliability
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Because the mapping never changes, Static NAT is ideal for services
          that depend on DNS records or firewall rules tied to a specific
          public IP address.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          This consistency simplifies troubleshooting and improves
          service availability.

          A Simple Example
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          An internal web server with a private address of 192.168.1.10
          is permanently mapped to a public address such as 203.0.113.10.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Any request sent to the public address is always delivered
          to the same internal server.
