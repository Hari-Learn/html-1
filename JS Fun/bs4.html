    <h2>🌐 What is Burp Suite?</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're playing a game where you talk to a robot (a website). Burp Suite lets you listen to what you're saying and what the robot says back. That way, you can learn if the robot is doing something wrong or if someone is cheating!</p>

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="box half-width">
      <h2>👂 Proxy</h2>
      <p>It's like a walkie-talkie that lets you hear every message between you and the website. You can also press "pause" to change things before they are sent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box half-width">
      <h2>🔁 Repeater</h2>
      <p>This tool lets you send the same message again and again, like asking “Can I have candy?” 10 times with different words. You see what answers you get!</p>

    <div class="box third-width">
      <h2>🤖 Scanner (Pro only)</h2>
      <p>A robot helper that looks for broken locks on websites — so bad guys can't get in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box third-width">
      <h2>🔐 Intruder</h2>
      <p>It tries lots of guesses really fast, like unlocking a toy box with every key to find the right one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box third-width">
      <h2>🔡 Decoder</h2>
      <p>It changes weird codes into normal words — like turning “%20” into a space!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box full-width">
