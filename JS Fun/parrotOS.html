    <h1>🦜 What is Parrot OS?</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine you have a super toolbox just for computers — and it helps you find problems, fix them, and even test how safe things are.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Parrot OS</strong> is like that toolbox. It's a special kind of operating system (like Windows or macOS), but built for people who want to do cybersecurity, hacking (the good kind!), coding, and privacy protection.
    </p>

        👶 <strong>ELI10:</strong> Parrot OS is like a superhero costume for your computer. It gives it special powers to test if things are safe, protect secrets, and do cool tricks that normal computers can’t!
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      🛠️ It comes with tools already installed — like scanners, encryptors, anonymous browsers, and hacking labs — so you don’t need to download them one by one.
    </p>

    <p>
      🔐 It's also used by ethical hackers, cybersecurity experts, and people who care about digital privacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      🌍 Bonus: It’s free and open-source, which means anyone can use it, learn from it, or help improve it!
