        Dynamic NAT Shares a Pool of Public Addresses Across Many Devices
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-5xl">
        Dynamic Network Address Translation, known as Dynamic NAT, allows
        internal private hosts to temporarily use public IP addresses from
        a shared pool. Unlike Static NAT, these mappings are created only
        when needed and are removed when communication ends.

          What Is Dynamic NAT?
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Dynamic NAT maps a private IP address to a public IP address
          selected from a predefined pool. The mapping is not permanent
          and exists only for the duration of the session.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Once the session ends, the public IP is returned to the pool
          for reuse by another internal host.

          Why Dynamic NAT Exists
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Organizations often have fewer public IP addresses than internal
          devices. Dynamic NAT allows these public addresses to be reused
          efficiently without assigning them permanently.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          This approach balances accessibility with conservation of
          public IP resources.

          The Problem It Solves
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Without translation, private IP addresses cannot communicate
          on the public internet. Static NAT, while reliable, requires
          one public IP per device.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Dynamic NAT solves this by allowing multiple devices to share
          a limited set of public IP addresses over time.

          How Dynamic NAT Works
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          When an internal device initiates traffic, the router assigns
          the first available public IP from the pool and records the
          mapping in its NAT table.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Incoming return traffic is matched to this entry and forwarded
          to the correct internal host.
        </p>

          A Practical Example
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          A company owns five public IP addresses but has fifty employees.
          Only active users are assigned public IPs at any given time.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          When an employee disconnects, the public IP becomes available
          for another user.
