        PAT Allows Thousands of Devices to Share One Public Address
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-5xl">
        As IPv4 addresses continue to run short, networks have adopted a method
        known as Port Address Translation, or PAT. The technique enables multiple
        private hosts to communicate with the internet using a single public IP
        address, relying on port numbers to keep conversations distinct.

          The Problem
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          The internet was not originally designed to support billions of devices.
          IPv4 provides a limited number of public addresses, far fewer than the
          number of computers, phones, and smart devices now in daily use.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Assigning a public IP address to every device would quickly exhaust
          the available address space.

          Why PAT Exists
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          PAT was introduced to conserve public IP addresses while still allowing
          widespread internet access. A router represents an entire private network
          to the outside world using a single public identity.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          Each outgoing connection is marked with a unique source port, ensuring
          that responses can be correctly identified.

          How TCP Stays Organized
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          TCP connections begin with a three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK.
          When many devices initiate connections simultaneously, PAT plays a
          critical role in maintaining order.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          By translating both IP addresses and port numbers, the router ensures
          that returning SYN-ACK packets reach the correct internal host.

          No Duplicate SYN-ACK Packets
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Without PAT, multiple internal devices would appear identical to an
          external server. PAT prevents confusion by assigning each session a
          unique port number, recorded in a translation table.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          When a SYN-ACK packet returns, the router consults this table and forwards
          the packet to the correct private IP address.
        </p>

          A Simple Example
        </h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
          A laptop and a phone may both access the same website at the same time.
          To the server, both connections appear to come from the same public IP.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm mt-3">
          The distinction lies in the port numbers, which allow the router to
          separate and safely deliver each response.
