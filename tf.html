    Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
    It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and services using a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
    With Terraform, you can create, manage, and version infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner.
    Key features of Terraform include:               
    - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: You define your infrastructure using code, which can be versioned and shared.
      - **Provider Support**: Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and services through plugins called providers.
      - **Declarative Language**: You describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform takes care of the rest.
      - **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure, allowing it to determine what changes need to be made.
      - **Plan and Apply**: Terraform provides a two-step process where you can preview changes (plan) before applying them (apply).
      - **Modularity**: You can create reusable modules to encapsulate and share common infrastructure patterns.
      - **Community and Ecosystem**: Terraform has a large and active community, with many pre-built modules and providers available.
